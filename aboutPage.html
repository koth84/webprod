                <h9>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.Barry: Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah! Let's shake it up a little.[gurgling]Kobe! Breakfast is ready!Barry: Comin'! Hang on a second. Hello?Barry?Adam?Can you believe this is happening?I can't believe it. I'll pick you up.Lookin' sharp.Barry, why don't you use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.Sorry. I'm excited.Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.Very proud.Ma! I got a thing going here.You got some lint on your fuzz.Ow! That's me!Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.Bye!Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house![horns honking]- Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry.- Is that fuzz gel?- A little. It's special day, finally graduating.Never thought I'd make it.Yeah, three days the grade school, three days the high school.Those were so awkward.Three days the college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.You did come back different.- Hi, Barry.- Hey, Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.- Hey, did you hear about Frankie?- Yeah.- You going to his funeral?- No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.- Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are!- Bee-men.- Amen!Hallelujah!Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.Dean Buzzwell: Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15. (clears his throat) And that concludes our graduction ceremonies."Barry": Yaa-hey!Dean Buzzwell: And begins your career at Honex Industries!Are we gonna pick our job today?I heard it's just orientation.- [horns honking]- Heads up! Here we go.Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.- I wonder what it's gonna be like?- A little scary.[both exclaiming]Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.This is it!Wow.Wow.We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...[all] Honey!- That girl was hot.- She's my cousin!- She is?- Yes, we're all cousins.- Right. You're right.- At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.[growls][crying][laughs]- What do ya think he makes?- Not enough.And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.- What does that do?- Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions.Can anyone work on the Krelman?Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life.The same job for the rest of your life?I didn't know that.What's the difference?Huh?And you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.So you'll just work us to death?We'll sure try.[all laughing]Wow! That blew my mind!"What's the difference?"Adam, how could you say that?One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make.Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.But, Adam, how could they'd never have told us that?Barry why would you question anything?We're bees.We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.Hey!Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?Like what? Give me one example.I don't know. But you know what I'm talkin'about.Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.Wait a second. Check it out.- Hey, Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow.I've never seen them this close.They know what it's like outside the hive.Yeah, but some don't come back.- Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks!You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!- I wonder where those guys have just been.- I don't know.Their day's not planned.Outside the hive, flyin' who knowswhere, doin' who knows what.You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.Right.Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it.Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it.Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too?Distant. Distant.Look at these two.- Couple of Hive Harrys.Let's have some fun with 'em.It must be so dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock.Yeah. One time a bear had me pinned upagainst a mushroom!He had one paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me back and forth across the face!- Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out.And what were you doing during all of this?Obviously, I was trying to alert the authorities.I can autograph that if you want.A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades?Yeah. Gusty.You know, we're gonna hit a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow.- Six miles, huh?- Barry!It's a puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it.- Maybe I am.You are not!We're goin' 0900 at J-Gate.Whoa.What do ya think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough?I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means.Hey, Honex!Oh, Dad, you surprised me.[laughing]Have you decide what you're interested in, son?- Well, there's a lotta choices.- But you only get one. Ha, ha, ha!Dad, do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day?Son, let me tell you something about stirrin'.You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around.You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing.Ya know, Dad,the more I think about it,maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me.And you were thinking of what,making balloon animals?That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.Well, no...Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey!- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny.You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer!- You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me!Wait until you see the sticks I have for you.I could say anything I want right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!Let's open some fresh honey and celebrate!Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.To honey!Shave my antennae.Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and start call everybody "dawg"!I'm so proud.- I can't believe we're starting work today!- Today's the day.Come on!

But that's life!Oh, this is so hard!Heatin', coolin',stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,hummin', inspector number seven,lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,mite wrangler.

We on our own.Every-every mosquito on his own.- But what if you get in trouble?- Trouble? You a mosquito, you in trouble.Nobody likes us. They just are just smack.See a mosquito, smack, smack!At least you're out in the world.You must meet girls.Mosquito girls try to trade up,get with a moth, dragonfly.Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.Whoa! You got to be kidding me!Mooseblood's about to leavethe building! So long, bee!- Hey, guys!- Mooseblood!I knew I'd catch y'all down here.Did you bring your crazy straw?[lordly honking][both laughing]Then we throw it in some jars, slap a label on it,and it's pretty much pure profit.What is this place?A bee's got a brainthe size of a pinhead.They are pinheads!Pinhead.[both laughing]- Hey check out the new smoker.- Oh, sweet.

Are you OK?Yeah. It doesn't last too long.How did you two get here?Do you know you'rein a fake hive with fake walls?Our queen was moved here.We had no choice.This is your queen?That's a man in women's clothes!- That's a drag queen!- [rumbling]What is this?Oh, no!There's hundreds of them!Bee honey.Our honey is bein' brazenly stolenon a massive scale!This is worse than anything bearshave done to us! And I intend to do something about it.Oh, Barry, stop.Who told you that humans are takingour honey? That's just a rumor.Do these look like rumors?That's a conspiracy theory.These are obviously doctored photos.Barry, how did you get mixed up in all this?'Cause he's been talking to humans.- What?- Talking to humans?!He has a human girlfriend.Oh, Barry.And they make out!Make out? Barry!We do not.- You wish you could.- Who's side are you on?The bees!I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.Man, those crazy legs kept me up all night.Barry, this is what you wannado with your life?This is what I want do it for all our lives.Nobody works harder than bees!Dad, I remember youcomin' home some night so overworkedyour hands were still stirrin'.You couldn't stop 'em.I remember that.What right do they have to our hard-earned honey?We live on two cups a year. They put itin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!Even if it's true, Barry, what could one bee do?I'm gonna sting them where it really hurts.In the face! In the eye!- That would really hurt.- No.Up the nose? That's a killer.There's only one place you can stingthe humans, one place where it really matters.Hive at Five, the hive's onlyfull-hour action news source.[screaming]No more bee beards![bear growling]With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.Weather with Storm Stinger.Sports with Buzz Larvi.And Jeanette Ohung.- Good evening.

I can't do this"?Larry, bees have never been afraidto change the world.I mean what about Bee Columbus?Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?Well, where I'm from you, wouldn't think of suing humans.We were thinkingmore like stickball or candy stores.How old are you?I want you to know that the entire bee communityis supporting you in this case,which is certain to be the trialof the bee century.Thank you, Larry. You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too.It's a common name. Next week on Bee Larry King...No, I mean he looks like you and he has a showand suspenders and colored dots behind himNext week on Bee Larry King...Old guy glasses, and there’s quotes along the bottom from theguest you’re watching even though you just heard them.Bear Week next week!They're scary, they're hairy and they're here live.Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,squinty eyes, very Jewish.Look, in tennis, you attackat the point of weakness!But it was my grandmother, Ken.

I try notto use the competition.So why are you helping me, anyway?Bees have good qualities.Si, Certo.And it feels good to take my mind off the shop.I don’t know why instead of flowers, peopleare giving balloon bouquets now.Yeah, those are great, if you're three.And artificial flowers.- Oh, those just get me psychotic!- Yeah, me too.The bent stingers, the pointless pollination.Well, bees must hate those fake plastic things!There's nothing worsethan a daffodil that's had work done.Well, maybe this could make upfor it a little bit.- You know Barry, this lawsuit's a pretty big deal.- I guess.Are you sure that you wanna go through with it?Am I sure? When I'm done withthe humans, they won't be ableto say, "Honey, I'm home,"without paying a royalty!Sarah, it's an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan,where all eyes and ears of the world are anxiously waiting,because for the first time in history,we’re going to hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak.What have we gotten into here, Barry?I don't know, but it's pretty big, isn't it?I can't believe how many humansdon't have to be at work during the day.Hey, you think these billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers?Folks. everybody needs to staybehind the barricade.- What's the matter?- I don't know, I just got a chill.Well, if it isn't the bee team.Any of you boys work on this?All rise! The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presidin'.All right.

I'm kiddin'. Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed.[Mr. Montgomery sighs]And Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please.[clears throat]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,my grandmother was a simple woman.Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine rightto benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us.If we were to live in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines,just think of what it would mean.Maybe I would have to negotiatewith the silkwormfor the elastic in my britches!Talkin' bee!How do we know this isn't some sortaholographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry?They could be using laser beams!Robotics! Ventriloquism!Olonin'! For all we know,he could be on steroids!Mr. Benson?[sighs]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,there's no trickery here.I'm just an ordinary bee.And as a bee honey's pretty important to me.It's important to all bees.We invented it!We make it. And we protect itwith our lives.Unfortunately, there aresome people in this roomwho think they can take whatever they want from us'cause we're the little guys!And what I'm hopin' that, after this is all over,you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only taking away everything we havebut everything we are!I wish he would dress like thatall the time. So nice!Call your first witness.So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, Pretty big company you have there.I suppose so.And I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron!Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms.Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term.I have to sayI don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?- No.- I’m sorry. I couldn't hear ya.- No.- No.Because you don't free bees.You keep bees. And not only that,it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey.Well, they're very lovable creatures.Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.Yeah, you mean like this?- [bear growling]- [screams]Bears kill bees!How'd you like his big hairy head crashin'be through your living room?!Bitin' into your couch!Spittin' be out your throw pillows![mimicking growling]OK, that's enough. Take him away.So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.Your name intrigues me.I have to say.- Where have I heard it before?- I was with a band called The Police.But you've never beena police officer of any kind, have you?No, I haven't.No, you haven't. And so herewe have yet another exampleof bee culture being casuallystolen by a humanfor nothin' more thana prance-about stage name.Oh, please.Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?Because I'm feelin'a little stung, Sting.Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner![crowd gasp]That's not his real name?! You idiots!Mr. Liotta, first may,I offer my belated congratulations onyour Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005.Thank you. Thank you.[laughing]I also see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsomebut with a churnin' inner turmoilthat's always ready to blow.I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you, Mr. Liotta?Exploitin' tiny, helpless beesso you don'thave to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir?Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now!This isn't a goodfella.This is a badfella!Why doesn't someone just step onthis little creep, and we can all go home?!- Order in this court!- You're all thinkin' it!Order! Order, I say!- Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!Well, I just think that was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that.I’m tellin' you, I think the jury's on our side.Are we doing everything right, you know, legally?I'm a florist.Right. Right. Well, here's to a great team.To a great team!Well, hello.- Oh, Ken!- Hello.Uh, I didn't think you were comin'.No, I was just late.I tried to call, but... the battery.I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.- Yeah.- Oh, that was lucky.Well, there's still a little left.I could heat it up.Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.So I hear you're quite a tennis player.I'm not much for the game myself.I find the ball's a little grabby.That's where I usually sit.Right... there.Mmm. [gulps]Ken, Barry was lookin' at your resume,and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill.You think I don't see what you're doin'?Hey, look, I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We certainly have that in common.Do we?Well, bees have 100 percent employment of course,but we do jobs like takin' the crud out.That's just whatI was thinkin' about doin'.Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.Oh!I'm gonna go drain the old stinger.Yeah, you do that.Look at that.[whistling]Ah! Oh![whistling continues]Y-yo you known, I've just about had itwith your little mind games.- What's that?- Italian Vogue.Mamma mia, that's a lotta pages.It's a lotta ads.Remember what Van said, why isyour life any more valuable than mine?That's funny, I just can't seem to recall that!Ah!I think something stinks in here!I love the smell of flowers.Yeah! How do you like the smell of flames?!Not as much. [screaming]Whoa!Oh! Ah! Ohh!Water bug! Not taking sides!Ken, look at me! I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!This is pathetic!I've got issues![screaming]Well, well, well, a royal flush!- You're bluffin'.- Am I?[yelling][laughing]Yeah!Surf's up, dude!Oh, poo water!That bowl is gnarly.Except for those dirty yellow rings!Kenneth! What are you doin'?!Ya know what, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it!We need to talk!He's just a little bee!And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life?No, but there are other things buggin'me in life. And you're one of 'em!Fine! Talkin' bees, no yogurt night...My nerves are fried from ridin'on this emotional roller coaster!- Goodbye, Ken.- Oh.[sighs]And for your information,I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man!I'm sorry about all that.I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it!I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.Are you gonna be OK for the trial tomorrow?I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.Now that’s a good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the very best lawyers...Yeah.Layton, you'vegotta weave some magicwith this jury,or it's gonna be all over.Don't worry, Mr Gammill. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury aroundis to remind 'emof what they don't like about bees.- You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?Only to losin', son. Only to losin'.Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know.What exactly is your relationship- to that woman?- [gasps]We're friends.- Good friends?- Yes.- How good?- What?Do you live together?Wait a minute, this isn’t about...Are you her little... [clears throat]...bedbug?Hey, that’s not the kind of...I've seen a bee documentary or two.Now from what I understand,doesn't your queen give birthto all the bee children in the hive?- Yeah, but...- So those aren't even your real parents!- Oh, Barry...- Yes, they are!Hold me back!You're an illegitimate bee,aren't ya, Benson?He's denouncing bees!And don't y'all date your cousins?- Objection!- I'm gonna pincushion this guy!Adam, don't! It's what he wants!- [groans]- Oh, I'm hit!!Oh, lordy, I am hit!Order! Order!The venom! The venomis coursin' be through my veins!- Please, Mr. Montgomery.- I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!Ya see? You can't treat themlike equals! They're striped savages!Stinging's the only thingthey know! It's their way!- Adam, stay with me.- I can't feel my legs.Take it easy.Oh, what angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poisonfrom my heavin' buttocks?Please! I will have order in this court. Order!Order, please!The case of the honeybeesversus the human racetook a pointed turn against the bees...Thank you!yesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.Now here’s Don with the 5-day.[sighs]- Hey, buddy.- Hey.- Is there much pain?- Yeah.I...I blew the whole case, didn't I?It doesn't matter. The important thing isyou're alive. You could've died.I'd be better off dead. Look at me.They got it from the cafeteriathey got it from downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.Look, there'sa little celery still on it.What was that like to sting someone?I can't explain it. It was all...All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!All right.You think that was all a trap?Of course. I'm sorry.I flew us right into this.What were we thinking? Look at us. We'rejust a couple of bugs in this world.What do you think the humans will do to usif they win?I don't know.I hear they put the roaches in motels.That doesn't sound so bad.Adam, they check in,but they don't check out!Oh, my.[coughing]Say, could you get a nurseto close that window?- Why?- The smoke.Bees don't smoke.Right. Bees don't smoke.Bees don't smoke!But some bees are smokin'.Adam, that's it! That's our case!It is? It's not over?No, Get up, Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.You get back to the court and stall.Stall any way you can.And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.[Mr. Montgomery grumbling]Mr. Flayman.Yes? Yes, Your Honor!Where is the rest of your team?Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly,and as a result,quite often we don't make very good time.I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee...Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugstaken up enoughof this court's valuable time?How much longer are we going to allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?They have presented no compellingevidence to support their chargesagainst my clients,who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.But you can't! We have a terrific case.Where is your proof?Where is the evidence?Show me the smoking gun!Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smokin' gun?Here is your smokin' gun.[crowd gasp]What is that?It's a bee smoker!What, this?This harmless little contraption?This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee.Oh. [chuckles]Members of the jury, look at what has happenedto bees who have never been asked,"Smokin' or non?"Is this what nature intended for us?To be forcibly addictedto these smoke machinesin man-made wooden slat work camps?Livin' out our lives as honey slavesto the white man?- What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card.Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees![crowd] Free the bees! Free the bees!Free the bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!The court finds in favor of the bees!Vanessa, we won!Yay! I knew you could do it! High-five!Sorry.Barry: I'm OK! Vanessa do you know what this means?All the honey is finally gonna belong to the bees.Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.[Mr. Montgomery clears throat]This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.You'll regret this.Barry, how much honey do you think is out there?All right. All right. One at a time.Barry, who are you wearing?My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants.- What if Montgomery's right?- What do ya mean?We've been livin' the bee waya long time, 27 million years.Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement?First, we're gonna demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed bad-breath stink machine. I believe we're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out.He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames...But it's just a prance-about stage name!...unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health productsand la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments.[humming]Oh, I can't breathe.Bring it in, boys!Hold it right there! Good.Tap it.Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more comin'!- I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We never shut down.Shut down honey production!Stop making honey!Turn your key, sir!What do we do now?- Hmm?- Mm-hmm.Cannonball!We're shutting down honey production!Mission abort.Aborting pollination and nectar detail.Returning to base.[bell dings]Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there.Oh, yeah?What's going on around here? Where is everybody?- Are they out celebrating?- No, they’re just home.They don't know what to do.They're laying out, they're sleeping in.I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.At least we got our honey back.Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of makin' it.This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well.And now...Now I can't.I don't understand why they're not happy.We have so much now.- I thought their lives would be better!- Hmm.They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people.You don't have any ideawhat's going on, do you?- What did you wanna show me?- This.What happened here?That is not the half of it.Oh, no. Oh, my.They're all wilting.Doesn't look very good, does it?No.And who's fault do you think that is?Um...Ya know, I'm gonna guess bees.Bees?Specifically, me.I guess I didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these others things.And it's not just flowers.Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.Well, that's our whole SAT test right there.So you take away the produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom.And then, of course...- The human species?- [clears throat]So if there's no more pollination,it could all just go south here,couldn't it?And I know this is also partly my fault.How 'bout a suicide pact?How would we do it?- I'll sting you, you step on me.- That just kills you twice.Right, right.Listen, Barry...sorry, but I gotta get goin'.I had to open my mouth and talk.Vanessa?Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going?To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena.They've moved it up to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying.It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it.Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.I never meant it to turn out like this.I know. Me neither.Tournament of Roses.Roses can't do sports.Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?Roses!Vanessa!Roses?!Barry?- Roses are flowers!- Yes, they are.Flowers, bees, pollen!I know.That's why this is the last parade.Maybe not.Could you ask him to slow down?- Could you slow down?- [tires screeching]Ahh!Barry!OK, I made a huge mistake.This is a total disaster, and it's all my fault.Yes, it kinda is.I've ruined the planet.and I wanted to help youwith your flower shop. Instead,I've made it worse.Actually, it's completely closed down.I thought maybe you were remodeling.Nonetheless I have another idea, and it'sgreater than all my previous great ideas combined.I don't want to hear it!All right, here’s what I’m thinkin'. they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park.All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.- Bees.- Park.- Pollen!- Flowers.- Repollination!- Across the nation!Alright, Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, California.They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.Security will be tight.I have an idea.Vanessa Bloome, FTD.Official floral business. It's real.Sorry, ma'am. That's nice brooch by the way.Thank you. It was a gift.Then once we're inside, we just pick the right float.How about The Princess and the Pea?Yeah!I could be the princess, and...yes, I thinkYou could beI’ve-the pea!Barry: Yes, I got it. Sorry I’m late. Where should I sit?Princess: What are you?Barry: I believe I'm the pea.Princess: The pea? It’s supposed to be under the mattresses.- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I’m gonna go talk to the marshall.You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco!Let's see what this baby'll do.- [tires squealing]- Hey, what are you doin'?!Then all we do is blend in with traffic......without arousing suspicion.And once we're at the airport,there's no stoppin' us.Stop! Security.- Did you and your insect pack your own float?- Yes.Has this float beenin your possession the entire time?Yes.Would you remove your shoes andeverything in your pockets?- Can you remove your stinger, sir?- Uh, that's part of me.I know. Just havin' some fun.Enjoy your flight.Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!I think this is gonna work Vanessa.It's got to work.[Pilot speaker] Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott.I’m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area.And looks like we’re gonna be experiencing a couple of hours delay.Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.I gotta get up there and talkto these guys.Be careful.Hey, can I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine?I'd like to order the talkin' inflatable travel pool filter.Excuse me!Excuse me! Captain, I am in a real situation here.- What'd you say, Hal?- I didn’t say anything.Ah, bee!No, no! Don't freak out! There’sa chance my entire species...What are you doin'? Stop!- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney?Don't move.Oh, Barry.[over speaker] Good afternoon, passengers.This is your captain speaking.Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit?And please hurry![gasps]What happened here?I tried to talk to them, but thenthere was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.Now one's bald, one's in a boat,And they're both unconscious!- Is that another bee joke?- No!No one's flying the plane!This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.What's your status?This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York.Where's the pilot?He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience?As a matter of fact, there is.- Who's that?- Barry Benson.From the honey trial?! Oh, great.Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.It's got giant wings, huge engines.I can't fly a plane.- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes.How hard could it be?Wait a minute, Barry! We're heading into some lightnin'.This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport,where a very suspenseful scene is developing.Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory...That's Barry!...is now attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.[all] Flowers?!Well, we have an electrical storm in the area,and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jetwith absolutely no flight experience.Just a minute Mr Ditchwater. There's a honey bee on that plane.I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson's work and his no-account compadres.Haven't they done enough damage already.But isn't he your only hope right now?Come on, technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.The wings are too small their bodies are too big....Hey, hold on a second. Haven't we heard this a million times?"The surface area of the wings and body mass doesn't make no sense."- Get this on the air!- You got it.- Stand by.- We're goin' live.Mr Ditchwater. the way we work may be a mystery to you.Because makin' honey takes a lotta bees doing a lotta small jobs.But let me tell you something about a small job.If you do it really well, it makes a big difference.More than we realized. To us, to everyone.That's why I wanna get beesback to doin' what we do best workin' together.That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O.We get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow!- Hello!Left, right, down, hover.- Hover?- Forget hover.Ya know what? This isn't so hard.Beep-beep! Beep-beep!Barry, what happened?!Wait a minute, I think we wereon autopilot that whole time.- That may have been helping me.- And now we're not!Well, then, it turns out I cannot fly a plane.All of you, let's getbehind this fellow! Move it out!Move out!Our only chance is if I do what I would do,and you copy me with the wings of the plane!You don't have to yell.I'm not yellin'!We happen to be in a lot of trouble here.It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice!It's not a tone. I'm panicking!I don't think I can't do this!Vanessa, pull yourself together. Listen to me. You have got to snap outta it![gasps] You snap out of it.You snap out of it.- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- [gasps] Hold it!- Why? Come on, it's my turn.How is the plane flying?- I don't know.- [phone ringing]Hello?Hey, Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?The Pollen Jocks!They do get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow.- Hello.All right, you two, what do you say we drop this tin can on the blacktop?What Blacktop? Where? I can't see anything. Can you?No, nothin'. It's all cloudy.Come on. You gotta think bee, Barry.- Thinkin' bee.- Thinkin' bee.Thinkin' bee! Thinkin' bee! Thinkin' bee!Wait a minute. I think I'm feelin' something.- What?- I don't know. But it's strong, and it's pullin' me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Brin' the nose of the plane down.Thinkin' bee! Thinkin' bee!
